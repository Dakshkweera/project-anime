Anime is home to some incredible battleground fantasies, such as Dragon 
Ball, Naruto and One Piece. However, if you are willing to expand beyond 
the happy hits, the creative genre is teeming with stories with dark 
psychological concepts. These make for the best psychological thriller 
anime series, immersing the audiences in a world where reality fades into 
illusions and the human psyche is explored with meticulous detail.

While anime enthusiasts appreciate a diverse array of storylines, 
psychological thrillers have the power to keep them on the edge of their 
seats â€” making them question their perceptions while probing the 
complexities of the human mind. From perplexing crime thriller animes 
including Death Note, Banana Fish and Monster to psychological battles 
in Ergo Proxy, Series Experiment Lain and Steins; Gate, these series are 
a testament to the power of good animation.

Classroom of the Elite is set in the fictitious Koudo Ikusei Senior High
School, a school that is renowned for providing its students with an 
extraordinary education. The plot follows Kiyotaka Ayanokouji, an intelligent 
student and his experiences in this highly competitive and complex 
environment. Additionally, the school students are categorised into four 
distinct rankings and those in the top tier enjoy exclusive privileges, 
whereas those in the lowest rank face second-class citizen treatment. 
The academy employs this hierarchy as a means of pitting students against 
one another and they are willing to go to great lengths to elevate their status.

Koudo Ikusei Senior High School is a leading prestigious school with state-of-
the-art facilities where nearly 100% of students go on to university or find 
employment. The students there have the freedom to wear any hairstyle and bring 
any personal effects they desire. Koudo Ikusei is a paradise-like school, but 
the truth is that only the most superior of students receive favorable treatment. 
Ayanokouji Kiyotaka is a student of D-class, which is where the school dumps its 
"inferior" students in order to ridicule them. For a certain reason, Kiyotaka was 
careless on his entrance examination, and was put in D-class. After meeting 
Horikita Suzune and Kushida Kikyou, two other students in his class, Kiyotaka's 
situation begins to change.

mysterious notebook that allows him to kill anyone he writes down in it. As 
Light begins to use the notebook to eliminate those he deems unworthy of life,

is good or right.
