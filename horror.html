Though most people's minds probably go to live action gore fests when
the spooky season comes around, anime has a smorgasbord of terrors to 
delight you with. Since the '60s, Japanese animators have been enchanting 
viewers with haunting myths. Often creating original stories or adapting 
terrifying manga tales, horror anime has become a powerhouse space for 
some of the most deranged, thoughtful, and unique genre storytelling.

While there are literally thousands of great horror anime series and movies, 
we've curated and ranked 5 of the best to ever do it. From paranormal thriller 
anime to supernatural serial killers through psychological nightmares and 
vampiric epics, there's something for every fear here.

when it comes to pure horror we have to stick with this classic. 
In an alt-history version of England where vampires run riot, the 
mysterious Hellsing organization is the only line of defense against 
the bloodsuckers and a dangerous new substance that looks to blur 
the line between vampire and human once and for all. Luckily, the 
Hellsing organization and its leader--the daughter of the famed 
vampire hunter Van Helsing -- have a secret weapon, the vampire 
Alucard. Unforgettable and ferocious nightwalker action makes this 
a horror anime for the books. And if you grew up in the '90s or '00s 
then it'll likely also instill a hefty dose of spooky nostalgia in you. 

Vampires and ghouls stalk modern-day England, hunting the oblivious 
populace. Only the Hellsing foundation stands between the evil undead 
and the innocent humans who would be their prey. But there's something 
new out there - chips that give humans vampiric ability and bloodlust 
are being sold as the latest designer drug. With a new wave of evil 
creatures rising, Hellsing must rely on its two most unlikely recruits 
- ancient master vampire Alucard and the newly turned Seras Victoria - 
but can even they stand in the face of such overwhelming odds?

Satoshi Kon is one of the masters of anime storytelling. And while
he has made multiple classics, his haunting psychological thriller 
Perfect Blue is one of his most influential and impactful films. 
After leaving her J-Idol group to pursue her dreams of becoming an 
actress, singer Mima Kirigoe's life begins to fall apart. The lines 
between real life and fantasy begin to blur as she's stalked by a super 
fan and struggles to separate her idol-self from her new career. Brutally 
brilliant, this is a true horror of the mind that will keep you guessing 
until the very last moment. But beware, this is arguably the most horrific 
and violent entry on our list, so don't go into this one expecting anything 
other than a deeply troubling watch that you'll never forget.

After a strange light appears in the sky, unexplainable events begin 
to plague a group of high school students in this atmospheric and entirely 
unique entry on our list. A sprawling ensemble story, the characters are 
connected together by a folkloric figure known as Boogiepop. Rumored to 
be the personification of death, the urban legend looms large over these 
bleak tales as a spate of brutal murders inspire a renewed interest in 
the mythic Boogiepop. Though the episodes are connected with an overarching 
mystery, you can enjoy it as an anthology of sorts, with each vignette 
drenched in creepy vibes and immaculately skin-crawling storytelling.

This twisty time loop take on folk horror follows a young boy Keiichi 
Maebara who lives in the seemingly idyllic rural village of Hinamizawa. 
But there are dark secrets afoot that seem to be connected to a strange 
government project. As Keiichi becomes more entangled with the mystery, 
things get darker and darker in this absolutely brutal tale. If you're 
a fan of puzzle box storytelling and slasher style kills with a conspiracy 
twist then you'll likely already be a fan of this infamous anime series. 
While the original 2006 iteration of the show is now pretty hard to find, 
there is an easily accessible 2020 remake currently available on Hulu. And 
if you're really digging that one you can also check out the prequel remake 
which came out in 2021.

Guts was brought up by a mercenary group since birth. After killing 
his guardian in self-defence, he runs away. Years later, he encounters 
Griffith and The Band of the Hawk. The Hawks fight for the King of 
Midland, and after winning the 100-year war against the neighbouring 
empire, they become the King's personal guard. However, once they reach 
the top, things take a turn for the worse.

The series owes its popularity to a combination of factors, including 
intense seinen storytelling, excellent character development, and unprecedented 
exploration of mature themes.
