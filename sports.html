Blue Lock's recent anime adaptation proves that the hype surrounding the 
manga was justified. Blue Lock's unique premise is critically acclaimed and 
was one of the best-selling manga of 2021. Blue Lock is about football but 
has a dystopian, gritty twist.

Jinpachi started the titular Blue Lock. It's a project to find Japan's best 
striker; somebody with an ego who isn't afraid to steal the show on the field. 
Thousands of players are summoned to the facility and forced to play against 
each other. Only one will make it to the national team. Isagi cost his team a 
significant win during the national tournament. He views Blue Lock as a chance 
to redeem himself and become a better player.

Japan keeps losing the World Cup, over and over. After Isagi Yoichi, a forward 
for a high school team, gets eliminated in the last game in the qualifier for 
nationals, gets invited to a program called "Blue Lock" Their coach will be Ego 
Jinpachi, who intends to "destroy Japanese loser football" by introducing a 
radical new training regimen: isolate 300 young forwards in a prison-like 
institution called "Blue Lock" and put them through rigorous training aimed at 
creating "the world's greatest egotist striker."

Slam Dunk stars Hanamichi Sakuragi after he joins his school's basketball 
team to befriend Haruko Akagi, the captain's sister. Though he initially 
only joined the club to get a girlfriend, Hanamichi fell in love with 
basketball and wanted to get serious about playing.

Slam Dunk has a great sense of humor and realistic character growth. 
Hanamichi's evolution throughout the series is believable and even relatable 
to some viewers. Unlike other protagonists, Hanamichi didn't start out with 
any natural athletic inclinations. Hanamichi's journey to being an excellent 
player was difficult, and he still has a way to go before he can even consider 
going pro.

Haikyuu! is the juggernaut and very best of sports anime and is excellent 
for younger viewers. Those who haven't watched the show have most definitely
heard about it. The series' lovable protagonist, Shoyo Hinata, along with the 
rest of the characters, drives the story. Even if someone doesn't have a 
particular interest in volleyball, Haikyuu! will immerse them in the sport.

Though Haikyuu! is primarily focused on Shoyo and the rest of Karasuno, many 
of the rivaling teams are lovable, and it's hard to dislike them. During games, 
fans root for all teams because they love characters from nearly every single one.

The emotion it gives you are so strong, u can't take your eyes off the screen 
until the ball drops. Also the character are so well written that it's impossible 
to hate them, and every single character is important and has a story.
